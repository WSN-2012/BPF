/**
 * "Another shared-implementation convergence layer class for use with reliable,
 * in-order delivery protocols (i.e. TCP, SCTP, and Bluetooth RFCOMM). The goal
 * is to share as much functionality as possible between protocols that have
 * in-order, reliable, delivery semantics.
 * 
 * For the protocol, bundles are broken up into configurable-sized segments that
 * are sent sequentially. Only a single bundle is inflight on the wire at one
 * time (i.e. we don't interleave segments from different bundles). When segment
 * acknowledgements are enabled (the default behavior), the receiving node sends
 * an acknowledgement for each segment of the bundle that was received.
 * 
 * Keepalive messages are sent back and forth to ensure that the connection
 * remains open. In the case of on demand links, a configurable idle timer is
 * maintained to close the link when no bundle traffic has been sent or
 * received. Links that are expected to be open but have broken due to
 * underlying network conditions (i.e. always on and on demand links) are
 * reopened by a timer that is managed by the contact manager.
 * 
 * Flow control is managed through the poll callbacks given by the base class
 * CLConnection. In send_pending_data, we check if there are any acks that need
 * to be sent, then check if there are bundle segments to be sent (i.e. acks are
 * given priority). The only exception to this is that the connection might be
 * write blocked in the middle of sending a data segment. In that case, we must
 * first finish transmitting the current segment before sending any other acks
 * (or the shutdown message), otherwise those messages will be consumed as part
 * of the payload.
 * 
 * To make sure that we don't deadlock with the other side, we always drain any
 * data that is ready on the channel. All incoming messages mark state in the
 * appropriate data structures (i.e. InFlightList and IncomingList), then rely
 * on send_pending_data to send the appropriate responses.
 * 
 * The InflightBundle is used to record state about bundle transmissions. To
 * record the segments that have been sent, we fill in the sent_data_ sparse
 * bitmap with the range of bytes as we send segments out. As acks arrive, we
 * extend the ack_data_ field to match. Once the whole bundle is acked, the
 * entry is removed from the InFlightList.
 * 
 * The IncomingBundle is used to record state about bundle reception. The
 * rcvd_data_ bitmap is extended contiguously with the amount of data that has
 * been received, including partially received segments. To track segments that
 * we have received but haven't yet acked, we set a single bit for the offset of
 * the end of the segment in the ack_data_ bitmap. We also separately record the
 * total range of acks that have been previously sent in acked_length_. As we
 * send acks out, we clear away the bits in ack_data_" [DTN2].
